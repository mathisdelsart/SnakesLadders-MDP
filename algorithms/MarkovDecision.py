    Solves the Markov Decision Process (MDP) using Value Iteration.
    This algorithm computes the optimal policy and value function for each state on the board.

    Args:
        layout (list): The layout of the board, specifying the type of each cell.
        circle (bool): Indicates whether the board is circular (unused in this implementation).

    Returns:
        list: A list containing two elements:
              - V_hat_k: The value function for each state (excluding the final state).
              - policies: The optimal policy (action to take) for each state (excluding the final state).
