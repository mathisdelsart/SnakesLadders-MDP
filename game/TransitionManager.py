        Computes the transition probabilities for a given state based on the dice roll and board rules.

        This function calculates the probability distribution of possible next positions 
        based on the outcome of rolling a die, considering special events and board structure.

        Parameters:
            state (State): The current game state, including the player's position.
            die (Die): The die used for movement, containing:
                - `probabilities`: Probabilities of each possible movement step.
                - `moves`: Corresponding movement steps.
                - `probability_triggers`: Probability of triggering a special event.
            board (Board): The game board, which defines cell types and special behaviors.

        Returns:
            dict[int, tuple[float, float]]: A dictionary mapping possible next positions to:
                - The probability of reaching that position.
                - The expected additional cost from triggered events.

        Movement Mechanics:
            - The function iterates through all possible dice outcomes and calculates
            the resulting position.
            - If the player is at the cell before the slow lane's first cell, an additional 
            offset (8 cells forward) is considered.
            - The function accounts for both regular movement and movement when an event 
            is triggered.

        Event Handling:
            - If an event is triggered upon landing on a cell, the probability is split
            accordingly between regular movement and movement affected by events.
            - The expected additional cost from events is accumulated in the probability 
            distribution.

        Board Constraints:
            - Movement respects board boundaries and special lane transitions.
            - The board structure and special event mechanics influence the probability 
            distribution of possible transitions.

            state (State): The current game state, which includes the player's position

        Returns:
            tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing:

            - `CellType.PRISON`: Keeps the player at their current position with a status of `1` (indicating prison).
            - `CellType.BONUS`: Keeps the player at their current position but applies a status of `-1` (indicating a bonus).

        Calculates the next position of a player on the board based on movement rules.

        This function updates the player's position by considering their step size, 
        additional offset, and specific board constraints such as lane transitions 
        and circular board behavior.

        Parameters:
            position (int): The current position of the player on the board.
            step_size_move (int): The number of steps the player moves forward.
            offset (int): Additional movement offset, which may result from special 
                        effects or lane transitions.
            board (Board): The game board, which contains information about its structure, 
                        including whether it wraps around (circular board).

        Returns:
            int: The updated position of the player after applying movement rules.

        Special Cases:
            - **Fast Lane to Slow Lane Transition**:
            - If the offset corresponds to the transition from the fast lane to the slow lane, 
                the movement is adjusted accordingly.
            - If the new position lands exactly on `SLOW_LANE_LAST_CELL`, 
                the player remains at the original position.

            - **Handling Gaps between Lanes**:
            - If the player is in the slow lane but moves out of its range, they are placed 
                in the corresponding position in the fast lane.

            - **Wrapping Around (Circular Board)**:
            - If the new position exceeds `FINAL_CELL`, the position wraps around 
                based on the total number of board states if the board is circular.
